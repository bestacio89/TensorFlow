README: Evaluation Script (evaluate.py)
This README provides a placeholder for the evaluation script (evaluate.py) in your TensorFlow-based deep learning project. The script is designed to load a trained neural network model and evaluate its performance using test or validation data.

Evaluation Script Structure
The evaluate.py script is structured as follows:

python
Copiar c√≥digo
# Import necessary modules and configurations
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
from config.paths import saved_models_dir
from data.datasets import load_data  # Adjust as per your data loading function

# Example: Load saved model
model = load_model(saved_models_dir + 'my_model')

# Example: Load and preprocess evaluation data
# Replace with actual data loading and preprocessing functions
evaluation_data = load_data('evaluation_data_directory')

# Example: Evaluate model
evaluation = model.evaluate(
    evaluation_data[0],  # Replace with your evaluation data
    evaluation_data[1],  # Replace with your evaluation labels
    verbose=1
)

print("Evaluation Metrics:", evaluation)
Usage
Replace the placeholders (load_model, load_data, etc.) with actual functions and configurations specific to your project. This script serves as a template for evaluating the performance of your trained TensorFlow models using saved models and evaluation data.
