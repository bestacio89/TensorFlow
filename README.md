### Project Structure Explanation:

- **data/**: Directory to store raw and processed data. `datasets.py` handles data loading and preprocessing tasks.
  
- **models/**: Contains `model.py` where you define your neural network architecture using TensorFlow's Keras API. Additional models or variations can be added here.

- **utils/**: Includes `helpers.py` for utility functions such as plotting training curves or saving/loading models.

- **config/**: Centralized package for configuring hyperparameters and settings for training and evaluation.

- **train.py**: Script to initiate and execute the model training process.

- **evaluate.py**: Script to evaluate the trained model on test/validation data.

## Getting Started

1. **Setup Environment**:
   - Install TensorFlow and other dependencies:
     ```
     pip install tensorflow
     ```

2. **Data Preparation**:
   - Place your raw data files in `data/raw/`.
   - Implement data preprocessing and splitting in `data/datasets.py`.

3. **Model Definition**:
   - Define your neural network architecture in `models/model.py`.
   - Optionally, include functions for loading pre-trained models.

4. **Training**:
   - Adjust hyperparameters and training configurations in `config.py`.
   - Run training using `python train.py`.

5. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate model performance with `python evaluate.py`.
   - View metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

6. **Customization**:
   - Expand `utils/helpers.py` for additional utility functions.
   - Add more models or variations in `models/`.

## Notes

- Customize paths, configurations, and functionalities according to your project requirements.
- Ensure compatibility with your TensorFlow version and hardware capabilities.
