README: Training Script (train.py)
This README provides a placeholder for the training script (train.py) in your TensorFlow-based deep learning project. The script is designed to train a neural network model using configurations and functions imported from the config/ package and other project-specific modules.

Training Script Structure
The train.py script is structured as follows:

python
Copiar c√≥digo
# Import necessary modules and configurations
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Dropout
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam
from config.hyperparameters import batch_size, epochs
from config.paths import data_dir, saved_models_dir, logs_dir
from config.model_config import model_layers
from config.training_config import optimizer, loss_function, metrics
from data.datasets import load_data

# Example: Load and preprocess data
train_generator, validation_generator = load_data(data_dir)

# Example: Build model using configurations from model_config.py
model = Sequential(model_layers)
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer,
              loss=loss_function,
              metrics=metrics)

# Example: Train model
history = model.fit(
    train_generator,
    epochs=epochs,
    batch_size=batch_size,
    validation_data=validation_generator
)

# Example: Save trained model
model.save(saved_models_dir + 'my_model')

# Example: Logging
with open(logs_dir + 'training.log', 'a') as f:
    f.write('Training completed.\n')

print("Training completed successfully.")
Usage
Replace the placeholders (load_data, model_layers, etc.) with actual functions and configurations specific to your project. This script serves as a template for training your TensorFlow models and demonstrates the basic structure using configurations imported from the config/ package.
